# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — mobile_frontend

## Overview
This document defines the product scope, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and compliance expectations for the mobile_frontend React Native (Expo) application. It is aligned with GxP standards and intends to guide delivery of a single-container mobile app without a backend. The application follows a modern “Ocean Professional” theme with a simple tab-based navigation pattern.

## Scope
The initial release focuses on delivering a single-container Expo React Native app with:
- A tab-based navigation shell (e.g., Home, Activity, Settings).
- Basic UI screens and theme integration using the Ocean Professional design tokens.
- Local-only state management with lightweight Context or store (no remote backend).
- GxP scaffolding for audit logging, error handling, validation, and future electronic signature support.
- Testing and validation practices to ensure quality and compliance, all within the mobile container.

Out of scope:
- Backend services, external APIs, or database storage.
- Complex role-based access controls beyond a local role concept for gating certain features.
- Full electronic signature workflow (captured as future capability).

## Goals and Objectives
- Provide a robust, consistent, and GxP-aware mobile application shell ready for future feature expansion.
- Implement foundational navigation, theming, and state management with a consistent UX.
- Ensure audit trail, validation controls, and error handling scaffolding exist and are testable.
- Achieve strong test readiness (unit coverage ≥ 80%) and documentation for compliance.

## Personas
- End User: Interacts with app features via tab-based navigation, expects a fast, consistent, and accessible experience.
- QA/Validation Engineer: Verifies requirements traceability, audit logs, error handling, and test coverage.
- Product Owner: Reviews progress against PRD, approves release gates.
- Developer: Implements features, maintains code quality, test coverage, and adheres to GxP controls.

## Assumptions
- No backend or database is required for the initial release; all data is local and ephemeral.
- The app will be built and run via Expo tooling with TypeScript strict mode and ESLint.
- The Ocean Professional theme will guide UI colors, spacing, and styles across the app.
- Future integrations may add backend and authentication/authorization, but initial app will include local stubs and scaffolding only.

## Constraints
- Must use Expo and React Native with TypeScript strict rules.
- Must maintain ≥80% unit test coverage for implemented modules.
- Must include GxP-aligned scaffolding: audit logging, validation, and error handling.
- Single-container, no additional services.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
Each requirement is assigned a unique ID (REQ-XXX) for traceability.

### REQ-001: Navigation Shell (Tab-Based)
As an end user, I want a simple tab-based navigation with 2–3 tabs so I can move between Home, Activity, and Settings.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Tabs are visible and accessible from the bottom area.
  - Selecting a tab switches to the corresponding screen.
  - Back navigation behavior is predictable and does not lose state unnecessarily.
  - Tabs use icons or labels consistent with Ocean Professional theme.
  - Testing includes navigation rendering and screen switching.

### REQ-002: Theming — Ocean Professional
As a user, I want a consistent theme that follows Ocean Professional so the app feels modern and coherent.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Global theme tokens are defined for primary (#2563EB), secondary/success (#F59E0B), error (#EF4444), background (#f9fafb), surface (#ffffff), and text (#111827), plus gradient definition (“from-blue-500/10 to-gray-50” as a reference).
  - Colors and typography are applied consistently across screens.
  - Components exhibit subtle shadows and rounded corners where appropriate.
  - Dark mode is out of scope for initial release but design is amenable to future extension.
  - Unit tests validate theme token presence and basic application.

### REQ-003: Local State Management
As a developer, I want a simple and predictable state mechanism so app UI state is consistent without a backend.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A Context or lightweight store abstraction provides app-wide state for minimal shared data (e.g., selected tab state, local preferences).
  - State initialization is documented, with unit tests for reducers/selectors where applicable.
  - No persistent storage is required for initial release.

### REQ-004: Audit Trail Scaffolding
As a QA/Validation Engineer, I need audit logging for significant user actions so I can verify data integrity compliance.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - An audit logger interface exists with methods to record action type, timestamp (ISO 8601), user context (local placeholder), and data before/after for updates where applicable.
  - For this initial release, events are captured in-memory or console with a consistent structure.
  - Non-repudiation is acknowledged as future work; electronic signatures are noted as future capability.
  - Unit tests confirm that audit functions receive correct parameters and format.

### REQ-005: Validation Controls
As a product owner, I want validation controls at UI entry points to prevent invalid data from being processed.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Basic input validation for any form components introduced (e.g., numeric ranges, formats).
  - Errors are displayed with user-friendly messages.
  - Validation failures do not crash the app; they are logged for technical visibility.
  - Unit tests cover valid/invalid data scenarios.

### REQ-006: Error Handling
As a user, I want the app to fail gracefully and tell me what to do next when something goes wrong.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Centralized error boundary or handler exists for UI-level failures.
  - User-friendly messaging is shown; technical errors are logged to the audit mechanism with stack traces where available.
  - Recovery paths are provided (e.g., retry or navigate home).
  - Unit tests cover error paths and logging behavior.

### REQ-007: Logging and Diagnostics
As a developer, I need structured logging for troubleshooting without leaking sensitive data.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A logger utility with levels (info, warn, error) is provided.
  - Logs avoid sensitive details and follow consistent structure.
  - Unit tests validate level filtering and message formatting.

### REQ-008: Settings Screen
As a user, I can view app info and adjust basic preferences (e.g., theme accent or text size) without backend storage.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A Settings screen exists under the tab bar.
  - Preferences update local state and reflect instantly.
  - Changes trigger audit events with “before/after” where applicable.
  - Unit tests cover preference changes and rendering.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- Performance:
  - Initial render in under 2.5 seconds on mid-range devices.
  - Navigation transitions under 200ms under normal load.
  - Maintain 60 FPS for typical interactions.
- Security:
  - No storage of sensitive data.
  - Defensive coding to prevent injection or unsafe dynamic code execution.
  - Adhere to least-privilege principles in any future role gating.
- Compliance:
  - GxP scaffolding present: audit trail, validation controls, error handling, and placeholder for future e-signature.
  - Traceability documented and maintained across PRD, architecture, and tests.
- Accessibility:
  - Color contrast adheres to AA where practical.
  - Screen readers announce key UI elements appropriately.
- Maintainability:
  - TypeScript strict mode enforced.
  - ESLint rules followed.
  - Clear folder structure, modular components, and documentation.

## Risk Assessment
- Lack of backend may limit meaningful audit persistence (Risk: Medium). Mitigation: In-memory or console audit with clear interfaces to plug in persistence later.
- Overhead of GxP scaffolding without backend (Risk: Low). Mitigation: Keep scaffolding lightweight and well-documented.
- Performance risks from unnecessary re-renders (Risk: Low). Mitigation: Use memoization and lean state slices.
- Future e-signature requirements not implemented (Risk: Medium). Mitigation: Document future capability and define interface contracts now.

- VP-AUD-001: Audit logging event format and invocation checks.
- VP-VAL-001: Input validation scenarios and error presentation.
