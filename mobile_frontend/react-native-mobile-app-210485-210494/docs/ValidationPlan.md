# Validation Plan — mobile_frontend

## Introduction
This plan defines the validation approach, test categories, coverage goals, and acceptance criteria for the mobile_frontend Expo React Native app. It aligns to GxP compliance expectations while recognizing the scope limits of a single-container app with no backend.

## Objectives
- Verify that implemented features meet functional and non-functional requirements.
- Ensure audit trail, validation controls, and error handling scaffolding operate as designed.
- Maintain ≥80% unit test coverage.
- Provide traceability between requirements, implementation, and tests.

## Scope
- UI navigation and rendering
- Theming and component styling consistency
- Local state management
- Audit logging and structured logging
- Validation of user inputs and error handling
- Settings screen interactions

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (≥80% Coverage)
- Components: rendering and props behavior.
- State: reducers and selectors correctness.
- GxP Utilities:
  - logger.ts: level filtering and format.
  - audit.ts: event shape, timestamp formatting, action codes.
  - validation.ts: valid/invalid inputs.
- Theme:
  - tokens.ts: token presence and immutability checks.
  - ThemeProvider.tsx: provides tokens through context.

### Integration Tests
- Navigation:
  - Tab switching and screen render assertions.
- Error Handling:
  - Error boundary fallback UI rendering and recovery actions.
- Settings:
  - Preference changes update UI and invoke audit logging.

### Validation Tests (GxP Focus)
- Data Integrity (ALCOA+):
  - Audit trail events are contemporaneous, attributable (local user context), complete, and accurate in structure.
- Compliance Controls:
  - Input validation prevents invalid data from proceeding.
  - Error handling logs technical details while showing user-friendly messages.
  - Logging avoids sensitive data exposure.

### Performance Checks
- Reasonable device startup time and 60 FPS for typical interactions.
- Navigation transitions under ~200ms on mid-range devices (best effort in dev environment).

## Test Data and Environments
- Use synthetic, non-sensitive data fixtures.
- Run tests in CI mode where possible (e.g., jest-expo in future).
- No backend or external service dependencies.

## Entry and Exit Criteria
- Entry:
  - Code compiles without errors.
  - Lint passes without severe warnings.
- Exit:
  - Unit test coverage ≥80% overall.
  - All integration and validation tests pass.
  - Traceability verified across PRD, Architecture, and Matrix.

## Risks and Mitigations
- No persistent audit trail (Risk: Medium). Mitigation: define interfaces to enable persistence later and verify event structure now.
- Limited device variation in CI (Risk: Low). Mitigation: document tested devices/emulators and retest as needed.

## Deliverables
- Test reports (unit and integration).
- Coverage summary demonstrating ≥80%.
- Updated Traceability Matrix mapping tests to requirements.
